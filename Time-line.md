# Cyber.Beast(History)

At one point there were 9-12 nations until the Cyber.Beast arrived and the world united into 1-3 factions resulting in the first change of the world order

The moon is an arch allowing the preservation and translocation of animals across the universe even to parallel worlds

## Year 0 C.C.

- Humans began to colonize the moon. Using resource only found on the moon CyTek creates a new quantum computer tech. They are marketed and sold to the earths nations as unhackable and indestructible. The blacks holes are placed around the moon or around earth's orbit
  - These Black holes all vibrate at the frequency of the Quantum.suniverse which allowed the DNA stored within its arc to enter the cyber.suniverse. This created the Cybervator virus

## Year 1 C.C.

- While on the moon they contract a virus. This prompts the leaders unsure of its origins to quarantine workers on a space station before they are allow back on earth. To make things more efficient most of the workers were prisoners.

- The prisoners would have constant chaos among themselves when not at work as the had little oversite from guards as they fear contracting the virus there self. The only thing keeping them from revolt was daily rations and the false promise of freedom.

## Year 10 C.C.

- Over a decade later however these "precautions" were futile something far worse than the virus appeared began to unsurface.

- The virus that had once spread across the globe left those that became unfertile and some diabled. A select group of people that contracted the virus had no synthoms carriers that had past virus to others. However eventualy the children of these carriers was born with a birth defect an aparent horn that grew from the backs of their head that grew into tails. Feared and ocsrtazied from society sent to stay on the moon which the virus came from to prevent futhur exposure

- Some of those that contracted the virus begin to hallucinate they would see Strange beast despite the fact that animals have never existed on the plant. The hallucinations were assumed to be from the fevers. The children of the infected began to have hallucinations as well but unlike the their parents whose hallucinations went away when the illness resided the children's never went went away.

- The beast could only be seen by cybervators who feared them and called them Cyber.Beast. Most humans however could not see them thinking that its was all in the heads of the children. They begin to stigmatize these kids calling them cybervators named after the virus their parents had.

## Year 12 C.C.

- Eventually these "imagined" Cyber.Beast began materializing wreaking havoc at times even destroying entire cities. They were unstoppable and would only stop during eclipses.

- Cytek begins to see a pattern to these events. 

  The first thing they noticed was that Cyber.Beast would never appear when their was no light. Cybervators claimed they all had the same reoccurring dream of be chased by cyber.beast. The same one that will eventually appear the day before it appears the same cybervator eaten in a dream would be eaten in real life. relatives eaten be a Cyber.Beast. The next day they were gone eaten by the Cyber.beast.

  This initially gave cybervators a little more respect as they used them to predict when cyber.beast would attack

  However this respect was short lived as people began to speculate the Cyber.Beast seemed to be attracted to the Cybervators. Where ever their were cybervators cyber.beast was sure to follow. 
  
  Then came the day a survivor had seen a cybervator turn into a Cyber.Beast before their eyes. This nations to demanded all Cybervators be placed on the moon.

  It was discovered the children of those that contracted the virus, who began grow tails and talk telepathically also began turning into beast. CyTek tries to covers it up sometimes sending the children to the moon taking them from their family leaving them with the prisoners on the moon

- With children now on the moon prisoners find a new way to keep the peace in a more civilized fashion while providing entertainment for the children

- The production of satellites is halted the moon is instead used for researching and developing ways to stop the cyber.beast. Prisoners are still sent to the moon however but instead of being used for labor they are experimented on. Those thought to be free was in reality killed during experiments

For years the cybervators suffered died and perished down in these craters. That was until they eventually turned on each other. In order to survive They began selectively sacrificing one sibling of families. The Cybervators would place them in the deepest most central parts of the moons craters.

## Year 15 C.C.

- On earth the virus continues to wreck havoc infecting many. Cyber.beast has decimated the armies of all of the nations. Mean while on the moon imprisoned scientist(Bursun's obsessed  future wife/mother) manages to turn bursun into the first cybervator. She believes that Cybervators are the next step in human evolution

- The only defense nations had against cyber.beast was the satellites using the solar energy stored within them to destroy the cyber.beast. It did not work however all they were able to do was destroy their own cities while strengthening the cyber.beast in the process

- It is eventually discovered that Cybervators are able to access this quantum cyberspace.
    - In the future it is how they get their powers to compete in their "barbaric" sport and when they become Mercenaries Cybervators that have been contracted by ReNet

- After Cytek discovers Cybervators abilities other nations become fearful of them Cytek insists they are harmless and may even become beneficial to other nation to use as a weapon

- Bursun saves all of those on the moon from the berserk cyber.beast and is placed on a pedestal

- CyTek created a technology called a limiter to prevent Cybervators from turning into cyber.beast.

- The NRA(Network Relations Association) is formed

- CyTek send Bursun along with cybervators to earth save humanity. Humans sentenced to labor on the Moon were forced to fight with the false promise of freedom in return for saving those on earth

## Year 25 C.C.

- With the old world order gone corporations take over. Not have the means to arm their self. Instead the resort to cyber warfare. They depend on Cybervators for police enforcement

- With the old world order gone and replaced by companies called networks Warfare had evolved to be mostly regulated in cyberspace. As the fear of cyber.beast begin to wear off more companies began adopting new cyber computers however this type of warfare became impossible. They were made from blackholes so destroying them was near impossible and even dangerous. Trying to combine blackholes was a slippery slop.

- Cybervators continue to fight but they fight each other with the continued false promise of freedom. They hired them out to companies as mercenaries tasked with capturing and defending satellites

## Year 50 C.C.

- The Cybervators eventually revolts having to defeat Bursun to gain their freedom. Bursun wants to remain a slave as he sees it as the easiest path in life. 

- They strikes a deal with the NRA to allow their complete freedom and recognition as a independent nation. The fact that Bursun defended the human is hidden from the world

## Year 55 C.C.

- Although they no longer control the Cybervators CyTek maintains thier monopoly on satellites which they continue to rent out to other Networks

- The Cybervators join The NRA(Network Relations Association) as ReNet.

- They join as a network monopolizing of the defense industry

- The Cybervators continue to support the humans on earth sending cybervators to defend the humans from occasional cyber.beast and serving as body guards/police. Outsourcing their services for resources in return but do not kill each other like in years past. This is the only way of life they now so it is how they continue to support their self

## Year 70 C.C.

- While on the Moon now called Bursun/CNS clans named after Cyber.Beast would always have an intense rivalry. A rivalry that was relegated to sport used to settle disputes between clans rather than war. They fought each other using cyber.beast they are paired with in a ritual as a child. 

- ReNets population continues to expand and the appearance of cyber.beast become increasingly rare. With no resources of their own serving as body guards is no longer a sustainable means to support the people of ReNet.

- The Cybervators become Mercenaries again secretly stealing satellites for other networks but unlike before they don't kill each other. Instead they only steal the satellites for the highest bidder.

- Kyshumu teams up with Xenos and Kassia but splits up after a disagreement

- Tomasina falls i'll doctors tell her family that their is nothing that can be done

## Year 71 C.C.

- They are able to contact Makkusu a teenage scientist from the Quantum.Suniverse who has been researching quantum mechanics

- Makkusu appears in the cyber.suniverse and apologizes informing them that the Ark was created in response to global warming of their world as a way to preserve and transport animals to other worlds. It was decided to make the virus that could only affect planets as no one thought it was possible for any world to have sentient plants. Although he does not understand the language he realizes that their number system is exactly the same as that of the Quantum.Suniverse

- Makkusu discovers that the virus that gave Cybervator their powers is the Flu/HPV/HSV from Helios

- Makkusu blaming his self for creating the virus takes it upon his self to save Tomasina. Makkusu begins experimentation first on plants. Makkusu kidnaps bringing her to his lab in the quantum.suniverse turning her into a cybervator. She is warned of the risk of death if it fails. She sees it as a dream come true as she always imagined what life would be loke as a cybervator never having to deal with her illness. He promises come to her universe to visit her.
        - Nurse: what do want to be when you grow up

          Tomasina: I want to be a cybervators that I wont be sick anymore. Then I'll be able to help save people the same way you're helping me.
          *The nurse has a look of pitty*

- Cytek sees it as an opportunity to create Cybervators of their own ones they can control

- The cybervators threaten to remove the protection from citizens of one of the earths networks. Cytek again begins to see the cybervators as both a threat an opportunity.

- As Tensions rise Cytek wants to use the cybervators as weapons again. CyTek insists that this is the best way to prevent a war. The blue clan agrees the Traik is less trusting

- They send Tomasina to win the Kings Tournament. If she fails they will go to war allowing Cytek company to aquire the ReNet Clan

- Back on earth CyTek Genetically modified adolescent into Blue.Type Cybervators to compete with ReNet as they feel humans should have the power

- Tomasina is genetically engineered as the first blue.type cybervator. So that Humans will no longer need to be reliant on cybervators for protection. She starts in Cyberspace and eventually qualifies to become a cybervator just in time for the tournament

- During her time in cyber.space she develops a relationship with Kyshumu

        Tomasina tells Kyshumu I bet you must hate us humans after all we have done
									  
        Kyshsumu: Well I... He looks at her
									  
        Well you see I can't really hate it because you're apart of this world too

- Tomasina enter a tournament to become the King of ReNet as the first blue.type cybervator. They soon discover that she is a human. Being an outsider the Cybervators bans her from being allowed to participate.

- Thanks to the relationship she built with Kyshumu in cyberspace he vouches for her to be allowed participate insisting that his father allows her to compete. He even points out a loop hole in the rules that should allow her to compete

- When Kyshumu insists that Tomasina is allowed to compete Traik warns Kyshumu that she is not just here to compete but to send a message. But that he well let her fight so that her people will no that they are no match for them

        She didn't come here just to win the tournement. It's a show of force

- She joins representing BluNet/CyTek. Although she loses the championship she wins the heart of Kyshumu. Before or after Tomasina loses he tells her that fighting in the real world is nothing like cyberspace that it may feel the same  but it is not that her body is not ready that he has lived his whole life as a cybervator and she has been one for all of one year

- With Tomasina failing her mission she warns the cybervators of a possible war.  They want them to be eventually integrated into society and forced to give up their "barbaric" sport. The winner would eat/suck the tail of the loser allowing them to take their cyber.beast

        Tomasina: The humans on earth think that you are a threat. They are afraid that when you killed all of the cyber.beast what is stopping from killing them next

        Tomasina: We know that you have be doing more than just slaying Cyber.Beast.

        Kyshumu: what is she talking about father				
        Traik: We have been hacking and sometimes even destory satilites for profits. They are unhacble to everyone accept cybervators 

        Kyshumu: Why											

        Traik:  There is no water on the moon. Once the Cyber.beast are gone there well be no way of sustaining our selves.

        Kyshumu: So we hack their satellites and they give use water													

        Tomasina: And if you're not careful it can turn into a all out war. 											

        Traik: how we would never fight each let alone kill each other. We settle our disputs in the tournament.

        Tomasina: Yes but we would. But thats not what I wanted. I figured that if I could win the championships war would'nt be necessary. Which is why I am asking we need some sort of partnership. We need to be more than just trade partners we need to be allies

        Traik: I would prefer to be allies as but my people would never accept such such dastardly/despicable/ridiculous terms. Give up a sport that has be apart of our culture for centueries/decades. Beacuse they consider it barbaric.

        Kyshumu: You're the King Can't you just make them

        Kyshumu/Tomasina: Why not you're the King arent you

        Bursun/Traik: it's not that simple. You think being a King means I can do what ever I want. As a King it is my duty to serve the will of the people. They didn't choose me because they wanted to unite our people with earth.

        Kyshumu: What do you mean. They didn't choose you. You became the because of your own will a determination. They didn't win the championships you did.
		  
        Bursun explain how the tournameent works through the councius will of the people and that cyber.beast are only a small part of the equation. He tells Tomasina/Kyshumu if they want to go through with this then it is up to them that they must win over the heart and will of the people

- Before or After winning the tournament Kyshumu surprise even Tomasina and exclaims that he will marry her that it will be the start relationship of not us just but her entire world. I will bring them our sport and all of its glories This sets up an arranged marriage which would allow the merger of the ReNet clan and the CyTek company. This would allow Tomasina to accomplish her goals. 

        Kyshumu walks from the podium

        Tomasina(wispers):  Did you forget my people think you sport is barbaric.

        Kyshumu: I'm sure we will come up with something

- CyTek continue genetically modifying Cybervator of their own they also hire out cybervators as cyber.beast hunters but the don't hack other satellites with them in order to avoid conflict. They do however employ them as police

- Eventually The cybervators achieved the goal of "eradicating" cyber.beast. This meant they needed a new means of trade to maintain sovereignty. This meant selling satellites to the companies that now run earth. Running out satellites They begin broadcasting their nations sport originally considered barbaric

- The CyTek merger and begins before the marriage can be made official as they need to first have a child in the mean time Tomasina goes on missions to slay Cyber.beast along side Kyshumu. The Ranks of the Blue.Type Cybervator steadily grows

## Year 78 C.C.

- Tomasina is reluctant of the planed marriage as she has begun to develop feelings for Makkusu

- Things move along smoothly until Tomasina tells Makkusu if not for her arranged political marriage that she would go back to his world with him. She puts her hand on his check and press her forehead and nose upon his. He assume that she is inviting a kiss.

        Makkusu: Ouch!

        Tomasina: What did you dooo!

        Makkusu: I'm sorry I thought you wanted to kiss.

        Tomasina: A kiss their is no food here to share a kiss with

        Makkusu talks to Jack

        Jack: what happened to you

        Makkusu: Tomasina. I tried, I thought... I kissed her

        Jack she pierced right through you lip. After all you did to help them. You don't deserve this

        Makkusu: No I deserved it

        Jack: a slap maybe. But this. This is uncalled for!

        (Tomasina leaves Kyshumu or her father returns)

        Father: You? You! You have deflowered my daughter inlaw.

        Jack(stepping in between): oh come on it was just kiss

        Tomasina: It’s not just a kiss! Sharing food is how we kiss. What you did is how we procreate.

        (she shows her deflowered chest)

        Jack: what happened to her breast!

        Father: I told you already, he deflowered her

        Jack: yea but I didn't think you meant literally… you mean to tell me your women's boobs are made of flower petals! What is wrong with you people!

        (Tomasina looking distraught)

        Father: No. What is wrong with you pe… (ople)

        Mack(Pushes Jack away): sorry what he is trying to say is that on our planet deflowered is a figure of speech

        Jack: don’t worry Mack I'll help you pay child support?

        Tomasina: child support? The NRA raises and supports our cybervators here.

- The political marriage between Kyshumu and Tomasina to soften tensions between to Cybervators and humans. this falls through after she has a child with Makkusu. Leaving Kyshumu no choice but to move on as he has his own child with the hope or promise that they will fulfill the contracted merger through thier marriage

## Year 79 C.C.

- Kyshumu moves on and has a child naming her Leona whose sister died while cyber.beast implantation process. Leona becomes jealous of Max as she is arranged to marry Jax. Max takes all of the time she thinks she deserves from Jax. She cries asking her father to kill Max and his family so that she can have Jax to her self

## Year 83 C.C.

- Mack/Makkusu Max's father who has been visiting Max is seemingly killed by Max as Kyshumu attempted to take Max and/or Jax away as it is to dangerous to bring him back to the quantum universe. 

- Max goes berserk because he wants to go back with his father killing multiple people including his father

- Max and Jax was never given a ritual to obtain their first cyber.beast. This is why Max goes berserk. Makkusu does not want Max and Jax to be people throught the ritual as she wants them to live normal live and does not want to risk them dying during the ritual 

## Version 1

- Max loses his memory after Kyshumu cuts his tail off Kyshumu tells Tomasina that he killed Max. He does not want tomasina to know that Max loss his memory and thinks she will be just as hurt as he was by his memory lose thinking that he would have been better off dead

- ReNet continues hacking satellites while CyteK offers they're service to defend satellites from ReNet. Out maned at first CyTek resorts to using prisoners even children of prisoner to fill their ranks. Many of them fight without knowing about it. Their deaths are hidden with the lie that they have short life spans

- Limited in number and sort on time. The humans use prison slaves regardless of age as blue.type. The older the subject the greater the risk. Being that they are prisoners they have no qualms about controlling them directly using tech created by Kassia. They promise them freedom if they consent a promise that will be revoked if they inform others. They begin to even arrest citizens for the small  crimes even inventing new laws so they can build their ranks. The majorty are 

- Blue Nation Cybervators are prisoners forced to fight many most or all fighting without knowing about it. The Blue nation sends blue slaves and CSDs to aid the nations in defeating Cybervators

- Kyshumu meanwhile starts to remove the remaining few liberties the human who are the minority on the moon has.

- Kyshumu does this all in an effort to protect Max and to hide the war from all including red cybervators because he started it and does not want the world to know as he fixes tries to fix his mistake. Those just below him fear his power so they dare not to expose it

- A complex civil proxy war starts as it is decided by Kyshumu that all of the Blue.Type Cybervators are dangerous and goes on a crusade to kill/imprison/enslave all of them starting with Max. It is believed to be a war in part  over the moons resources which they use to create satellites that full the Cybervators

- The civil war is fought between the moons humans and cybervators. CyTek Supports the humans who have for years felt oppressed. Other companies back the Cybervators

- Against the wishes of Kyshumu Xenos begins cutting the tails of Cybervators rather than killing instructing his cyber.fights to do the same

- Xenos and/or Minia/Airiona discovers that Blue.type Cybervators are being forced to fight against their will. She informs Kyshumu who does not believe him. Kyshumu blames that fact that Xenos has been cutting the tails of Cybervators as the reason they do not remember fighting

- People on the outside looking in are led to believe it is not a civil war but is instead a Cybervators turning cyber.beast slaying into a gladiator like sport. Along with cyber warfare at first

- With the need to go on the offensive the Cyber.Ops are formed under the guise of a terrorist organization called the Cyvolters

- Xenos leaves ReNet joining the Cyvolters citizens are lead to think that he was traded. His plan is to end the war while Kassia's is freeing the humans

- Eventually the true Cyvolters are formed with Max becoming a founding member and Xenos eventually stepping in to become the leader. They have the goal of liberating the Humans of the moon

## Version 2

- Mack/Kassia comes up with the idea instead of hacking satellites for the highest bidder they could instead force companies to participate in their tournament wager their satellites instead with the cybervators from ReNet and CyTek serving as the champion. Tomasina suggest they wont believe in the whole collective conciseness thing. Instead they use something more tangible bit gems as the primary incentive. The add a second layer on the original format. This allowed top cybervators to be chosen as reps rather than the top 12 fight with no affiliation

- Max goes Berserk and Xenos is killed but Max retains his memory so Kyshumu does not hide Max from his mother

- Ace becomes the youngest cybervator with Alex becoming the first Cyber.Coordinator. He surprises everyone by choosing Alex as his partner coining the term cyber.coordinator. Many excuse him for his desicion assuming it to be the fault of his naivety due to his age
