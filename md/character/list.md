# Characters
## Max
They changed the rules because of how well he played his position and he was a transcendent player. Stats don t measure his impact on the game. he redefined the game

Max's prostetic eye gives him the sight of a xybervator so he can keep up with their speed. it also alos him to hperlink in cyberspace with his cyber.beast like a xybervator as well as with other xybervators with subtitles

Because Max is a blue.type allowing to hold to lines of thoughts simultaneously, as a center he has the ability to duel wield.
