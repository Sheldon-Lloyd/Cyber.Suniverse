# Cyber.Fighrer.League
The rules were created by an algorithm to most efficiently prevent war and maintatin peace and order
- Encourage globalization citizens are incentived to travel interact and move in other cities as they follow their favorite players the are on the same team as cybervator from a race that in the past would considered an enemy. Being closer to a team you support increases the likely hood of them wining
- teams are made of 5 one from each of the five races and are forced to be dependent on each other
- wagering Satellites rather than stealing satellites
- Monitoring everyone
- Maintain balance
Rules that are set does not have to be followed but not following the rules can result in losing fans in the middle of a match reducing the market value of a team which means less gems and a reduced chance of winning

Fans and players are one in the same. This is because fans can play any of the positions or none at all.

Since fans and players are one in the same If a player wants to switch teams they must offer themself up for trade. The team they select or in which someone on that team selects them must all vote in favor of the trade. 

Each player has a trade value based on their team ranking. They can trade for a gems of equal value, trade player for player or player plus gems for player. In other words if the team a player wants to join has higher value then their team they must pay to join that team. This applies for xybervators and humans. Sometimes in the case of a player for player trade in which gems are used to offest the value teammates will donate and to play for a player they want. The same thing can happen even without another player involved if the team that the player wants to join wants the player they to will pay for the player when voting giving money to their own team 20-30% of which goes to the CNS. Sometimes mutiple teams would want the same player in such cases the player goes to the highest bider of the players choice

Cyber.Fighters are alerted when hubs/satellites are attacked by "Cyber.Beast" It is on a first come first serve basis only 1-2 will fight the Cyber.Beast

Fans suggest play style and/or player selection/substitution

during the preliminary fans can submit strategies and tactics for cybervators that they have a stake in at any point during matches. Cybervators can select strategies before matches during matches or in between rounds

Fans can use analytics to determine what cyber.beast stock they will buy before during and after matches in both cyberspace and the championships

The cyber.fighter with the most bitgems is crowned the cheif

## Uniforms
BluNet wears white and blue uniforms
ReNet wears Black and red uniforms
A cybervator's number is on their back when in synergy and is on their CSD/Cyber.Beast when not fused


Rather than mandatory teams choose the makeup of their team. After the success of eclipse having only 3 cyber.fighters other networks decide to diversify and specialize teams. This is what prompted blunet and renet have 2 red and 2 blue types and a green type serving as the center.

the a team and it's members must be in good standing with the NRA in order to compete. other than that there is no discrimination as fans will usally be the ones in charge of who gets to compete through votes

## Teams
Rather than mandatory teams choose the makeup of their team. After the success of eclipse having only 3 cyber.fighters other networks decide to diversify and specialize teams. This is what prompted blunet and renet have 2 red and 2 blue types and a green type serving as the center. Renet chooses the 5 best cyber.fighter regardless of their satellite's gems. Blunet chooses the 5 best satellites. Among the satellites choosen they then choose best red green and blue types from those 5 satellites regardless of overall rank

Cyber.fighter champions often select based on stats like hieght, weight speed and strength. Were as fans tend to vote based on character. But in the end votes are suggestions part of a larger equation which includes an ai but the final decision lies with the team captain who picks a team they can ultimately work best with.

Each team will have at least one cyber.beast with a flying,floating, or swimming type abilty and they must protect it from being corrupted at all cost otherwise thier striker and center will be unable to fly and they will lose

### Striker
### Guard
### Center
it is the center/coordinator's job to choose the right cyber.beast to pair with the cyber.fighter. if matches are in space swimming/flying type cyber.beast would also need to be considered.

Cybervators usually don't become Centers because they can not score enough points to become MVP. This because in order to take up this role they would have to keep their eyes open. This means they won't have time to synergize with their cyber.beast in between rounds. Any Xybervator that becomes a center will have to sacrifice personal glory for the good of the team.

Humans also are better support fighters because they use CSD's fused with a cyber.beast that can absorb energy endlessly while watching and coordinating the match at the same time.

Support roles can only be fulfilled by humans as cyberbeast would try to fuse with a xybervator

Because they are humans they don't have to worry about affinities or vices so they can use what ever cyber.beast they want. They can even use the cyber.beast of their teammates

## Energy bits
The avalible energy a cyber.beast or cyber.fighter has to fight with.

## Cyberspace
### Duel
2-on-2 fights that are triggered by a challenge to fight over a seeded cyber.beast after someone misses fails to match the resonance of the seeded cyber.beast. Cyber.Fighters then have 220 seconds to complete the match before the seed hatches attacking both cyber.fighters

In cyberspace Rgree.types have long range finishing moves that they use to break the firewall that is suroundnding the gem of a cyber.beast. This can only be done when the cyber.beast uses up all of it's energybits It uses 80-100% of their energybits which means they wont be able to fight anymore. 

## Hubs
A team must match the gems required to hack the satellite of the hub. These are the gems that are used to resonate with the hub. If the hacking team loses they lose their bitgems/satellite but if they win they gain the bitgems/satellite of the hub they are hacking

A team will drop their satellite on the defending home teams hub allowing them to take over the satellite or gems directly hacking it from the hub.

It works by forcing a hyperlink. This is done by having the center match the vibrational frequency of the hub. It then must match the off-beat frequency of the satellite connected to the hub

As soon as the attacking teams satellite runs out of energybits the defending team wins. If Attacking team finishes taking over the satellite or taking that years aloted bitgems they win 

The defending team can attack and knock the satellite off of the hub to prevent it from being hacked by guarding it. This is done with the finishing move of the center. The guard is able to block the attack absorbing it's energy or rebounding it back. So the guard must not be in the way for this to be a success

The center and striker carries the satellite and fights to plug it bag into the hub to complete the resonance

There are 5 levels to be hacked after hacking a level they must move down a level until they reach the 5th lowest level. Each level it takes a longer time to hack the satellite
