# Setting
## World
The planet sits in a 2 star solar system orbiting them in a way that prevents night from ever occurring. It's moon however has an orbit that causes 0quit frequent eclipses this is the only "night fall" that can be experienced.

The planet only has winter on the north and south poles. No one lives on these poles so people don't ever experience winter.

The planet has 24 hour days and 365 day years.

Everyone lives on a single supercontinent with the only continent of the planet other ice masses on the north and south poles.

The inhabitants of the world call their planet earth like our own. Despite calling their self humans these people have evolved from planets instead of animals so they have wooden bones. Have 3 Sun in living in an environment in which the temperature is always bordering around 100 degrees they have brown skin. But it is not brown to block the suns rays but rather to help them better absorb light to use as energy. As they age they get darker to help them better absorb the sun.
## Inhabitants
The binary star solar system is perfect for the inhabitants as they have evolved from plants instead of animals. This, however, caused them to evolve without rods thus have zero night vision. Essentially being dryad's they only need water and sunlight to stay alive although they do require some nutrients which they get from fruit.

They are a combination of the birch tree, air plant, and dodder plant. It is theorized that they began as dodder plants and took the DNA of the air plant and birch tree.

This gave them the wood which became the skeletal system of the birch tree. Because the cambium of the birch tree evolved to serve their circulatory system and skin they don't have a central heart.

Having the digestive system of the air planet means they don't need to be rooted to the ground and only need water and light to survive, but they still partially inherited a dodder digestive system meaning they have an appetite for other plants. They only need to eat in order to grow through a process called kleptoplasty. This is when they take chloroplasts from the plants they eat making it into their own.

Once they reach maturity their growth slow significantly. If they overeat in a short period of time they will become fat but if they slightly overeat over an extended duration they will grow in height instead. Because they enjoy food it is a large part of their economy and is endorsed by cybervators. The weight they gain is extremely difficult to lose and is only lost from cell damage along with fasting. This will cause the fat to be turned it whatever organ is damaged -- Making the micro-tears of muscle from exercise the best and maybe the only way for a Non-Cybervator to lose weight.

Only the women develop a reproductive system they reproduce after taking the DNA of another man or woman by biting them on the tongue. Once they get new DNA their breast will turn into seeds or embryos. Once fully grown the seed will essentially become the brain located in the head.

The brain also serves as the heart. This means in order for them to be killed they need to have their brain damage or head cut off. All organ damage is healed over time and can grow back upon removal. However, only a Cybervator's limbs can grow back and only while synergizing.

Being plants they can survive in the vacum of space for a decent amount of time 1, 2 so they developed spacesuit technology.

They kept their dodder plant muscular system which sits in between the wood(bones) and cambium(skin).

The average height is 6'-5" for men and 6'-0" for women. The average life span is 200 years.

### Races
There are 3 races
#### Xybervators
The original Cybervators biological robots. They can see [seconds into the future](https://www.quantamagazine.org/to-make-sense-of-the-present-brains-may-predict-the-future-20180710/) but can only see one possible future this what makes them more proactive to the point of being impulsive--acting first and not thinking later. An artist type but aggressive in nature with high emotions, they tend to work in entertainment. Since they are extroverts and think best collaborating and building on the ideas of others. They come up with new ideas and concepts impulsively so it is not refined. This makes them great testers to make improvements. Being emotional makes them easy to manipulate though despite being paranoid of everyone especially when it comes to trusting authority. They have a habit of pressing actual and metaphorical buttons


**Physical description:**
They are left hand domanint and have green hair, eyes, and ears that will turn red when they are in hyperdrive mood. They tend to be shorter in stature compared to blue.types and green.types

They have a tail that only grow when hyperlink with a cyber.beast and grows even fast when exerting their physically while hyperlinked

Red cybervators are born and thus will always have red hair

They tend to be right handed

**Fighting style:**
Both hands can emit energy but it gets a large amount since no other part of their body has it. Most of their energy when they have synergized forms around their upper body utilizing its abilities and elements at high capacities. Red class fighters are often aggressive, due to the Cyber.Beast synergizing closer to their head. They have an affinity for using cyber.beast with high strength and like to divert the most of their energy toward strength
An aggressive style that tries to beat their opponent before they have a chance to fight back using power attacks, attacking first and asking questions later they specialize in the use of hands to fight. Their specialty is the grinding(grunt work) weakening defenses. They like fighting close quarter not giving their opponents a chance to react and so they can react faster. 

Offense: Attacks are widespread affecting all of an opponents armor at once. When they attack multiple times every hit builds momentum from the last hit.

Defense: Their defensive strategy is blocking attacks with attacks. Focusing on cross-blocking techniques and attacking before they are hit first

#### Xybrids
There hair eyes and ears are green but will turn blue when the in hyperdrive mode blue types are made so their hair on turns in fusion

They They tend to be left hand as something in the genetic makeup of left handed people allows them to become xybrids

#### Humans
