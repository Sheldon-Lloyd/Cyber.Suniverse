A liberatrian society that ensures freedom with corprate funded ubi. While Networks provide a ubi subnet provide jobs by which citizens are incentived to work as the more profit a company earns the higher their earnings determine its limit giving everyone skin in the game. People can work for what ever compny in which their values most align. Orignal these values were represented by a single Cyber.Fighter. In order for satellites to be allowed to particpate in the CNS citizens must vote for at least one cybervator to sponser as thier champion before each match. Companys are named after thier cyber.beast masscot. At least 50% of the gems given to the choosen Cyberfighter and  the gems they earn is given back to the citzens of that voted for them ontop of the Networks ubi that comes from the 30% in company taxes. Knowing that gems make a cybervator stronger citezns are more inclinded to vote on poltical view rather than skill. This shows a satellite what it customers and freelancers believe in. Citizens dont have to vote for the subnet or even network they work for. However it is rare for some one to vote outside of thier subnet and even rarer to vote outside of their prefered network. The citizens with the highest bid becomes the owner of that satellite and champion cybervator. Citzens can work for and collect ubi from more than one subnet but must stay within their contracted network.

The top Cybervator is considered the chief of the Network for which they belong. The chief along with the satellite they get to set the rules for said network

Satellites and networks will often model their self after winning satellites and networks in hopes of obtaining cybervators and their accompanying voters in a similar manner. When it comes time for cybervators to choose satellites

The chief dictates the required rules for cybervators of the network including how can and cannot compete as well as the network match ups and over all strategy. Before kyshumu retired he took it upon himself to take on the strongest of BluNets satellites and cybervators.

ReNet get ubi for good behavoir socail credit or provide loans in hopes of funding a funding a business. or geting paid for promtion or sharing ads with others

BluNet get loans to learn or be idle paid for by previous student debt intrest rate those that miss to many payments are remove from the UBI system until the debt is paid

The CNS pays for survalince data of both humans and citizens

provide a ubi for serculating money within a network rather than taxing for hoarding or transfering to a different curency allows networks to compete for lolaty based reward programs

Children are guided down a particular path based on competence but it made to appear as if it is their choice but its not ( http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/how-to-raise-a-genius-lessons-from-a-45-year-study-of-supersmart-children/)

Kids are keep within the same group and are tought by Ai and asisted by teachers. They only stay in school for the time it takes to learn becoming teacher assisnts in their own right if they gradute early.

there is no college instead gradutes are trained by the satellites they are contracted to. The jobs and satellite they choose is based on recommendations given by an Ai sytsem based on school blood/color type and test given

Punishment is only as long as needed the primary form of punshment is rehabiltstion for the smallest of crimes labor house arrest for the most serious of crimes

Some satellite reduce crime by tying basic income to good deeds some satellites give recurring payment other may provide payment for each good deed. In some instances citzens tip other citzen to reward good citizenship. Others especially for reccuring payments it is based on ratings you get from interacting withothers. Such as presing a like button if you like the interaction you had rather in person or over the internet. sometimes it is based on recorded interactions anylzed by Ai. They are funded by loans and taxes/royalties and even direct donations and othertimes donation pools. good deeds are further encouraged by leaderboards. Good deeds noticed by more people means more donation this means the most notable of good deeds are given the biggest rewards.

Some satellites provide a loan based that with a flat intrest rate. the loan and intrest is taken out of what ever profits is made. A person cannot however sit thier and not work as worker a placed on a curve and the lowest performing works 3 quaters in a row or 3 time all together are fire for underperformance.  It is not a true ubi, it makes more like a job without hourly wages. Instead pay is based productivty of the company as a whole and senority of an individual.

## CNS
It allows networks to demonstrates their power without killing and to settle difference with a wager. This will make it so that the loser will be more compliant and less likely to seek a more violent revenge-- Knowing they can wait until the rematch to redeem what ever they lost

Since network have their laws the satellites they collect gets those laws as well but if a citizens does not agree with said laws they can leave once their contract expires. This means that networks and subnets can not enforce any law they want upon their citizens. however contacts also means that citizens can not bounce from hub to hub which gives them a chance to decide if they like any new laws that may be created. And can leave if they no longer like it when their contract expires. They become entitled to the services of that satellites Cybervators

satellites represents divisions of companies with cyber.beast being the name and mascot of the division https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yo4POIw5Zn8

voting is done by tournaments rather than the council selection bulk of ubi is based in CNS league rather than company goverment  based

By simply being apart of the CNS networks affords its particpants a ubi as they get a base level income from selling data or being monitored and get increasing income based on the value of thier data or views they get. This affords cybervators and those in the media(commentators) can make more as more people will want to watch them.


## Manipulation and social conditioning
The CNS is rigid matches and who satellites will be given to is already decide by an AI inorder to maintain peace and order. So if some manages to win despite this rigging the system would be exposed

## Cheif
they commander and cheif of the CNS is in charge of the protecting humans from cyber.beast and all threats. They are in charge of cybervators fom both the blunet and renet subnets

### Collective leadership
the greater the bound of group of people the stronger the collective will power of the people become increasing the influence they have on the world. This means if the people of a nation does not stand behind the will of it's leader they will become fragmented reducing the ability they have to enforce the will of their nation upon that of another nation. It allows them to warp and bend the rules of that nation if the world combines they will be able to shape the rules of the world.

## Surveillance State
Other than the AI everyone within the same hub is responsible for watching each other this includes cyber.fighters
