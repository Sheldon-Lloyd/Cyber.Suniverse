Green.types can absorb and rebound attacks using their sheild

Any cybervator can go into cyberspace even without a cyber.beast but it isn't permitted as this will allow untamed cyber.beast to take over them causing them to go berserk like in times past.

one of the ways this is prevented is providing all cybervators with a cyber.beast once their tail reaches a certain length which will protect them from other Cyber.Beast while sleep during a Cyber.Beasts hatching/mating season ever 2-3 months

## White.Type Cyber.Beast
White.type cyber.beast a primarly flying and swimming based

unlike black.type cyber.beast white.type cyber.beast don't eat other cyber.beast they only contain them. They also only go berserk when they see a black type cyber.beast. They will only attack another white.type if a cyber.fighter tells them

Unlike Black.type cyber.beast white cyber.beast are not humanoids in cyberspace and are not found in cyber.space they are what you can call primordial cyber.beast. There sole purpose is to contain black.type cyber.beast. This doesn't mean they won't go berserk but it just limits what they will attack and maybe will only make the cybervator berserk if it sees a black.type cyber.beast and try to seal it within it self. Unlike black.type cyber.beast they store thier own energy so they don't need to steal from cybervators they do share bitgems with them when they fused however so they still need to meditate. This is why green.types donâ€™t slowly lose energy instead they slowly gain energy

They have the ability to duplicate a quantum entangled version of their self. This allows multiple people to use it at once

Fusing with a white.type cyber.beast as the base gives the fighter an all white armour and when they add a black.type cyber.beast there are purified so to speak so it will be all white armor.

## Black.Type Cyber.Beast
Most Black.type cyberbeast are land based and tranverse space by bending spacetime. 


Black type Cyber.beast that are used by CSDs are contained by the primordial white.type cyber.beasts that are in satellites.
