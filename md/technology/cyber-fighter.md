## Red.Type
Xybervator

80% of a Red.type energy is diverted to their arms. 

When they are using a black.type cyber.beast as their primary cyber.beast they lose 20% less energy when attacking with their legs. They will take no damage and absorb 50% of the energy from short range attacks of their opponent when their legs are strucked.

When they are using a white.type cyber.beast as their primary cyber.beast they will rebound long attacks from their opponent when their legs are strucked. They take no damage and 20% of the damage is applied to the attacking cyber.fighter instead.

Being first generation Cybervators Red.types can also fuse with black.type cyber.beast by it's self for 220 seconds without going berserk as they can serve as thier own limiter but will have un purified black armor. This is one of the primary reasons they serve as guards. 



## Blue.Type
Xybrid

80% of a Blue.type energy is diverted to their legs. 

When they are using a black.type cyber.beast as their primary cyber.beast they lose 20% less energy when attacking with their legs. They will take no damage and absorb 20% of the energy from short range attacks of their opponent when their legs are strucked.

When they are using a white.type cyber.beast as their primary cyber.beast they will rebound long attacks from their opponent when their legs are strucked. They take no damage and 50% of the damage is applied to the attacking cyber.fighter instead.

Blue.types will go berserk as soon as they fuse with a blacktype without a whitetype to limit it

In order to hyperlink without going berserk a blue.type needs a white.type cyber.beast as their base cyber.beast. They don't need a black.type cyber.beast to go into hyperdrive. They can however fuse it with their white.type cyber.beast when in hperdrive mode

 Blue.Types being better at dodging usally serve as strikers


### Finish move / final attack
blue types have powerful long range attacks that use 100% of energy.


## Green.Type
Human
Green.types long range attacks are just as strong a their mid-range attacks that can deal sustained damage

 With out a energy sheild or fire wall. They can only take maybe one hit by which they are auto ejected/teleported by an algorithm that ejects a cybervator the moment an attack comes within milimiters of landing without a sheild to cancel the atteck.

Unlike red.types and blue.types green.types have the ability to teleport because/given that

Green.types given that even when flying a humans body is not built to move like a Xybervator, their primary form of movement is teleporting between objects or opponents they or a teammate have recently landed an attack on or been attack by.

Green types are auto switched out before contact can be made preventing them from getting injured since they don't habe armor nor a healing factor

When a green.type is taken out a team loses the abilty to swap players during rounds. This is because they don't need to meditate between rounds.

shields from green types also deal damage which is why you want to avoid them hitting them with long range attacks instead

If a green type cyber.fighter tries to uses a Cyber.Beast they don't have the skills to control it will go berserk after th intial attack. To prevent this a fail safe is triggered destroying the cyber.beast in the process. The stronger a Cyberbeast the more complex the code/rythem/controls

green.type can only use a cyber.beast for a short amount of time based on the skill they have in terms of maintaining vibration frequency resonate entagle of that cyber.beast it is the same frequency every time so the experience they have with the same cyber.beast the more of the sequence that they can memorize. If they attempt to continue using the cyber.beast after missing the frequency they risk losing control of the cyber.beast. 

They can have a cyber.beast turn into a clone of their self by having their cyber.beast bite them to absorb their DNA 

Like Red.types Green.types don't need a satellite inorder to use a black.type cyber.beast in cybspace.


### Final attack / finishing moves 
They are powerful long range attacks that uses all of the energy of the Elemender at once. It results in the cyber.fighter immeditlly ejecting afterwards and subbing out for the cyber.fighter they are paired with. They are only blockable by the arms/legs of a red.type or blue.type.

Black.types Cyber.beast emit a multidirectional difused blast damaging those on the outside and protecting those on the inside. 

white.types types emit a unidirectional large energy beam.
