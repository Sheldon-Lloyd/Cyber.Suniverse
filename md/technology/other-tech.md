## Satellie
The Black holes in the satellites all vibrate at the frequency of the Quantum.Suniverse which allows the DNA stored within its arc to enter the Cyber.Suniverse. This created the Cyber.Beast

They house white.type cyber.beast 
the crystal found on the moon that is the primary material of the satellite

## Xybervator
Because they were built to mine recources for satellites they are design to be able to seekout the materials that make up the satellite this makes them naturally attracted to satellites as well. They are in part made out reources that make up a satellite this is why their tail glows when they are close to a cyber.beast and why they are able to fuse with them
