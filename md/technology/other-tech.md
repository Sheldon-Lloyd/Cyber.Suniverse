## Satellie
Given that they have a black hole the data they can store is unlimited. 

Light is stored in crystals and directed into the center of a satellite creating a kugelblitz which also serve as a quantum computer

This is what allows the transfer of information and matter creating wormholes via quantum tunneling. If the black hole is strong enough it will enable teleportation to another universe instead of another place in space

The Black holes in the satellites all vibrate at the frequency of the Quantum.Suniverse which allows the DNA stored within its arc to enter the Cyber.Suniverse. This created the Cyber.Beast

Because they store light they also act as a dyson swarm telporting eneergy to hubs

They house white.type cyber.beast 
the crystal found on the moon that is the primary material of the satellite.

Satellites house all of the black.type cyber.beast collected by the satellites members. It includes bit.gems as well collected from cyber.beast and other cybervators. During the championship 

When paired with a cyber.beast with the ability to fly, swim, or float, Cyber.fighters can use satellites to move through space. It slowly leaks energy when synergized. This is what allows them to float in place or move around. The satellite has a small jet stream caused by hawking radiation. The direction of the jet dictates the direction they fly in. We hen stationary it spins around creating a halo effect. The satellite can also be used to unleash a long-range attack. For blue and red.types, it becomes a finishing move as it uses all of the cybervators energy allowing them to take out a satellite in a single shot. For green.types it becomes a weapon that can be used continuously given they don't need to meditate to recharge

### Dyson Swarm

## Xybervator
Because they were built to mine recources for satellites they are design to be able to seekout the materials that make up the satellite this makes them naturally attracted to satellites as well. They are in part made out reources that make up a satellite this is why their tail glows when they are close to a cyber.beast and why they are able to fuse with them

## Elemender
A device that acts like the tail of a cybervator

It has a software that allows a human to control CSD's turned into cyber.beast 

It creates an backpack on the user that rapidly absorbs energy to be used for the Cyber.beast that are hyperlinked to the elemender

It allows a greeen type to use as many cyber.beast as they want during combat and is only limited by thier own skills. The more cyber.beast they use the more inputs they will need to control them. although they can use as many cyber.beast as they want they can only control 3 at a time one for movement guided with vision and command intent the other to with the elemender. they can attack manually but defense is automated
### Version 1
### Version 2

### Version 3
reads the mind of the cyber.fighter in order to play the tune need to control the 

## CSD
A multipurpose device that is primarly used to contain cyber.beast

CSDs were intially used as a means to control the first Cybervators of which were red. They were also a way to monitor them in case they go berserk so that another cybervator can easily teleport to their location to kill them. This was because at one point Cybervators were considered dangerous and was isolated on moons away from socity. Here they learn to control their abilites and develop a culture of their own. They were only allowed to return to socitey as long as they agree to be monitored.

For a Xybervator they hold the cyber.beast until they are ready to use them. This prevents the cyber.beast from possesing the Xybervator they are assigned to. In the past a xybervators only way of prevent this would be to stay virtuous. It also prevents any stray cyber.beast from binding to the xybervator as they also serve as a beacon attract cyber.beast to it instead devouring them in the process. This will make the cyberbeast strong akin to hunting them but this rarely happens because cyber.beast are being hunted 24/7 leaving few stray cyber.beast

When they are ready for use the Xybervator hyperlinks with it allow the the CSD to envolpe the cyber.fighter in a body of armor. serving as a limiter it will disengage from the xybervator at the first sign of it them going berserk

The default base cyber.beast of a CSD is always the satellite the CSD is hyperlinked with. Users can choose the base cyber.beast of their CSD. Which ever cyber.beast they choose will influnce what the CSD looks like.

Black.Type cyber.beast unlike white.types(free) are own by the person that originaly captured the cyber.beast. They can be duplicated and rented out to other people for a price equal to how strong it is. This also how humans can choose personal Xybervators that can serve as a protecter inside and outside of cyberspace.

### Controler
#### Version 1
hoods and/or facemask are also used as blinders
cyber.coordinators use visor to see for the xybervator through the camera of the CSD
the csd follows the Xybervator and becomes their eye
This makes it so that the Xybervator/cyber.beast only sees what the cyber.coordinator wants them to see.

Kassiea created the tech enabling the control of Cyber.Beast however it was clunky and required input from a keyboard. This made it a liabilty. Before Max Kassiea was the only cyber.coordinator that was able to use it real time. This lead them to use to instead control Cybervators using comanders intent--preprograming the cyber.beast ahead of time. With Max's help Kassiea created the nerulace so that normal people can use it.

#### Version 2
Originally created by Kassiea to control cyber.besat in cyberspace through her CSD. It was repurposed to work on Xybervators outside of cyberspace as well. It allows cyber.beast and Xybervators to be controlled though command intent as they preprogam what they want the cyber.beast/cybervator to do the rest is up to them. they can entervine slight by dictating what they see other than that they have no other control

### As a weapon
Projectiles for red and blue types are the cyber.beast itself but for green.types it is parts of the animal such as wing teeth or claws

The cyber.beast grow as they get stronger to the point by which they can be ridden as opposed only being used  as a weapon or carring the cyber.fighter

### Phone
When talking on the phone people of the option to use audio only  use goggles or to use holgrams project from their CSD

### Hyperlinking
When Cybervators are fused it is like they are hearing the voice of the Cyber.Beast telling them what to do as like schizophrenic people the their inner voice and the Cyber.Beast are separated. This also holds true when hyperlinked to people

allows cyber.fighters to read each others mind by all sharing the same white.type cyber.beast

## Network Hubs
A collection of hyperlinked satellites that governs the CSDs within said network

The receiver respsonsible for destributing data any solar energy that comes from the satellites

Hubs are the solution to only being able to have one person hyperlinked to a satellite. It serves as a proxy firewall providing permission to CSDs hyperlink with a satellite. It taps into the white.type cyber.beast's obsession with containing black.type cyber.beast, but only allows partial containment. It works similar to a block chain in that all other users must accept the hyperlink with the new person. Like a blockchain user also get paid for voting on new users if they align with the majority decession. This makes it so that a CSD is require inorder to participate world as they can't connect to a satellite without one. 

Fans sit and watch in hubs that uses a black hole that creates a 3d projection of Cyber.Fighters matches that are fought in satellites that they call cyberspace. In the secret war era battles were mostly fought outside of cyberspace/satellites

## Cyberspace
where cyber.beast can be found and captured
