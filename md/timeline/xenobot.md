# Cyber.Beast(History)

## Year 0 CC

### Humans began to explore/colonize the moon

Using resources only found on the moon CyTek creates a new quantum computer tech. They are unhackable and indestructible satellites that are placed around the earth's orbit

The indestructable satellites created by Cytek were used as lasers that can attack any location on earth and sold to 12 major nations for an ongoing proxy war on earth.
___

### Xenobots are created

Cytek Creates Xenobots man made creatures that are attracted to the crystals making it easier to find them. 

## Year 1 CC

### Xybervators are created
To make the process even cheaper Cytek created humaniod xenobots by splicing them with human dna. THey are called Xybervators. They can both find and mine the crytals needed to create the satellites
___

### Xenobots are cloned
Through cloning they are able to mass produce the Xybervators along with cyber crystal that the satellite is made of.

Cytek realizes they no longer need to look for the crystals but can create them by cloning Xenobots and turning them into satellites. This process would kill them as they can no longer store energy need to live.

### The rights of Xybervators are questioned
People begin to question the rights of the Xybervators as people begin to believe that Xenobots and Xybervators might be sentient. This is especially considered given the fact that can be cloned

### Civil war starts
A civil war breaks out on the moon as they fight to be a independent nation in order to free the Xybervators from slavery. 
___

It quickly turns into a proxy war as nations fight to take down the Cytek organization who many nations decide is unethical and dangerous. Other nations secretly back Cytek
___

### Xybervators join the fight
It's discovered that cybervators can hack into satellites by meditating, allowing them to Astro project into cyberspace. They can then go into the satellite and hyperlink with what they called cyber.beast housed within it.

They started controlling the things that were connected to the satellite.
___

The Xybervators then join the war some as slaves and others as freedom fighters. At first they are used to take over satellites by hyperlinking with them. They soon realize they can be used as guards for the satellites. This is because only one person can be go inside a satellite at a time.

## Year 2 CC

### Xybervators are targeted
Militarys begin to target Xybervators with the lasers that are meditating to free up the satellites so their own xybervators can cybersquat in the satellite in their stead. This doesn't work however as the satellite protects them from them laser beam. 
___

 The cyber.beast in satellites which are adapt to finding Xybervators are used for hunting Xybervators before they are hyperlinked targeting them with its lasers.

### First gen Hubs are created
It's learn that satellites protect the Xybervators they are hyperlinked with making invulnerable
___

To protect hunted cybervators that aren't hyperlinked underground hubs are created. 

The Xybervators that are hyperlinked are placed in a circle at the top of the hub forming a barrier protecting the humans and xybervators in panoptic rooms underneath

## Year 3 CC

### Jac is contacted
While trying to figure out how to hack satellites another universe is discovered allowing the scientist named Jac from the quantum.suniverse to assist the cyber.suniverse in understanding cyber.beast and creating new technology.
___

### Xybervators go berserk
Xybervators begin going berserk as they begin to attract what they call black.type cyber.beast. They get the name because they turn the xybervator into a black cyber.beast after hyperlinking with them. This is opposed to being white like the satellites that already have a cyber.beast inside of it 

They they first start attacking the hyperlinked xybervators near by. This lead to the discovery that berserk xybervators can defeat hyperlinked xybervators. 
___

The enslaved Xybervators are then intentionally turned berserk and sent to destroy hyperlinked Xybervators. It's a reakless move however as Xybervators would wipe out entrire cities as collaterall damage.

### Bursun and Yaharia learn to tame cyber.beast
Bursun and Yaharia becomes the first xybervators that learn to tame the cyber.beast they fuse with. They defend the Xybervators against the enslaved berserk xybervators.
___

Given that through their actions they save citizens as well xybervators people begin to look up to them as war heroes.

Although they were previously enslaved by Cytek Bursun and Yaharia escape and join the freedom fighters

### Other Xybervators are tought how to tame cyber.beast
Yaharia teaches the human Xenos being virtous allows a xybervator to tame their cyber.beast. He goes on to train other xybervators to do the same.
    
    All Xybervators attracted cyber.beast that has a vice similar to their own the trick is to master that vice once you do the you will be the master of the cyber.beast that embodies that vice as well.

    Once you have your first cyber.beast you will be able to use it to dive into cyberspace to fight other cyber.beast it gives you the opportunity to make the one you have stronger. But you have to be careful because if you lose to said cyber.beast you have to potentail to go berserk

    The job taming it is also never over you will always need to resist that vice as much as possible. the more control you have of that vice the better you can contorl cyber.beast of that vice. 

    High level Cyberbeast are able to adapt over the course of battle this is why cybervators tend to fight in pairs. This means they will constantly switch with your partner so that it can't adapt.

    When cybervator can also go berserk if they lose control of their emotions. Emotional bonds can be the biggest trigger so it's best to have as few as possible
    



## Year 4 CC
### Humans exist the frontlines
Humans on both sides of the war are no longer allowed to fight. Battles are now fought between free and enslaved Xybervators with humans serving as cyber.coordinators
___

### The first Cheif is appointed
The Freedom Fighters wants the Xybervator to choose a someone lead as the commander and cheif of their soilders. The Xybervator decide to hold a tournament to select the Cheif.
___

Bursun Becomes Chief of the freedom fighters. All though he does not lead them he serves as inspiration and a figure head to the freedom fighter.
___
### Xenos becomes a drill sergeant
Xenos starts teaching soilders how to defeat Berserk Xybervators by cuting their tail off. This means the don't have to die and can no longer hyperlink with cyber.beast

    Xenos: My name is Xenos.

    I have been training this generation of Cybervators to fight in this war.

    I don’t do it because I believe in war.

    I do it because I believe it is the best way to end the bloodshed.

    Bursun and Xenos/Yahaira charges at each other with Xenos pointing
___

With Xenos as the coordinator Yaharia Traik becomes the first Xybervator freed from being a slave without cut off their tail.
___

Because Traik looks up to Bursun and as a thank you for Xenos saving him Traik decide  to join the freedom fighters

    Serotonin is a Xybervators chi so living a life of virtue makes a cybervator stronger. They unleash thier power by letting thier opposing vice and cyber.beast take over. It is why the cyber.beast of pride is the hardest to control. A cybervator must take their greatest vice and supress for the rest of thier life else thhe cyber.beast will take over. limiters help by punishing cybervators everytime they are tempted by their vice.
___
CyTek creates the first CSD which allows them to control the berserk cyber.beast
___

Xenos becomes Eclipse as he decide he wants to do more than train and coordinate the Xybervators, he wants to join the fight as well. His first mission is during an eclipse which is how he gets his name. He is able to save multiple Xybervators without cut off their tails. 

When they are freed they are not forced to join the war however many do join.
___

Xenos continues train Xebervators and serve as a cyber.coordinator but also goes on missions with Yaharia and Traik as Eclipse. This adds a new Dimension to the war

## Year 5 CC
The tides of the war change as it is discovered and revealed by spike that Yaharia is pregnant this means Xybervators can have children.
___

The war is coming to a close with the freedom fighters looking to be the victors. After capturing one of the Cytek satellites a plan is discovered to kill Xybervators as last ditch effort. They plan do it prefectly timing laser blast targeted at Xybervators during the next lunar eclipse.

Bursun decides he wants to kill all Xybervators as a way to free them. He plans to do this by using the freedom fighter satellites to blow up the moon during the next eclipse
___

Yaharia tries to convince Bursun to not kiil the Xybervators by telling him that she is the Xybervator that is pregnant.

    Yaharia: Did you forget your a Xybervator too do you plan on killing yourself.

    Bursun: I'm doing this for the next generation. A generation that will be better off without people like me

    Yaharia: Is that what this is about!

    Yaharia: Is this your way for trying to make up for your past

    Yaharia: As soon as you have children you no longer have the right to your own life

    Bursun raise his eye brow

    Yaharia: it belongs to your children.

    Xenos: What are you talking about, you're not making any since

    Yahaira: I'm pregnant

    Xenos: Impossible

    Spike: No it's true I found out during her last systems check Which makes Bursun a uncle

    Bursun: Isn't this what you wanted Yaharia a future your child can live in

    Xenos: And who is to say that our child won't be a Xybervator too

    Bursun: You dont have to worry about that but this, this right here... If you saw what I have seen you would understand I have no choice
    --or--
    Bursun: You don't understand I have no other choice do you really want your... no our child to live in a world like this a world in which they no free limited to be nothing but a slave. You said it your self you wanted to make the world better for future generations.

Xenos tells Spike if I don't make it just make sure the world knows that Bursun was the hero even if it means I have to be the villain. The world would never accept Cybervators otherwise. Spike asks him but what transparency? Xenos replies I've learned that you can't have everything and that there is a balance and a time and place for everything.

Xenos survives and Bursun is defeated during an Eclipse by his sister Yaharia, Xenos, and Spike

Before Bursun dies he warns the other Xybervators not to oppress humans, not for the sake of altruism but for the sake of there children's children as they never know when a grandchild may become a part of the humans you hate so much. And if people in power create a world that hates citizens, then your future grandchild may be the one that is hated.

The world now hates Eclipse for killing Bursun a "war hero"

Everyone beleives that Eclipse is apart of Cytek and that they planned on destroying moon. This prompts nations to pull out of support of Cytek and those with in the orginization to stage a coup d'état

A warrant is put out for the arrest of Eclipse who is declared a war criminal

Although Bursun is Yahaira's brother their marriage was fabricated to prevent citizens from knowing that she had a child with Xenos(Eclipse) to maintain her pure image and to keep everyone's role in the war hidden from history
___

The Xybervators begin living on the moon independently as ReNet

Yaharia/Bursun/Spike initially wants to do away with the tournament and appoints Xenos be the first Chief and to lead every but he resign due to his past actions. Yaharia, however, believes those mistakes are what will make him the perfect leader.
___

The Cheif's tournament created during the war to determine the chief of the freedom fighters continues after the war but is modified by Spike. This is because they believed that the champion is chosen based on how much support they get from the people.
After the war, they used it to keep order as well. Instead of rebelling they fight in the tournament and support their favorite fighter. 

Traik Wins

## Year 6 CC

With the war over the cybervators were now free and created a civilization called ReNet on the moon they sustained themselves economically by working as freelance guards for satellites as some Xybervators were still stealing and selling satellites on the black market.

It becomes a coveted job as people can literally earn money while they sleep as long as they link up while going to sleep.

They would guard them in teams of 3 guarding the satellite 8 hours at a time. One would meditate the other 2 would stand guard of the meditating cybervator
___

Xenos II is born
___

The Cheif's Tournament is modifed to prevent Xybervators from stealing satellites from eachother

Instead of stealing satellites, they wagered them during the tournament. They even made a part of the contract for guarding satellites. After each tournament organization would sometimes have to hire new Xybervators to guard their newly acquired satellites other times fire Xybervators because they lost satellites

The war results in the collapse of the old world order

With the old world order gone the world becomes led by corporations called networks and the NRA is formed to maintain relations between networks one of those networks being ReNet

Companies take it upon themselves to provide aid for the citizens. However, since the NRA no longer allowed regional-based governments, companies would instead recruit people to be decentralized members. This causes companies to treat people as if each person essentially were an individual company. If the company no longer likes a member, they can excommunicate them and a member can just as easily leave a company they no longer agree with
___

The Cybervators join The NRA(Network Relations Association) as ReNet.

As a part of the deal it is required for all Xybervators to have to have a CSD as a form of surveillance. They were monitored them in case they go berserk and so that another cybervator can easily teleport to their location to kill them.

They join as a network monopolizing of the defense industry

The Cybervators continue to support the humans on earth sending cybervators to defend the humans from occasional cyber.beast and serving as body guards/police. Outsourcing their services for resources in return but do not kill each other like in years past. This is the only way of life they now so it is how they continue to support their self

## Year 7 CC

Cytek monopolizes 80% of the companies the other 20% is protected by their partnership with ReNet

## Year 27 CC
Kassiea and Xenos III is Born

## Year 28 CC
Tomasina and Kyshumu is born

## Year 42 CC
Kassiea discovers a gene that some humans have that allows grow tails with crystals and become Xybrids. It is one which degrades with time. The older someone is before their first cyber.beast entaglement the more likely they will go berserk due to decreased compatiblity likely do to a developed prefrontal cortex
___

Kassiea creates a injectable serum that allows human to become a xybervator 
___

Kassiea best freind Tomasina becomes gets a severe injury. In order to save her Kassiea turns Tomasina into a blue.type against the orders of her superiors. 
___

Tomasina becomes the first xybervator to fuse with a white.type cyber.beast that are housed in satellites and not just hyper.link giving her the ability to fly with web wings
## Year 43
Makkusu comes to the cyber.suniverse by astroprojecting into a CSD. He tells them that he has been the one helping them the whole time. What he didn't realize though is that he was mostly helping cytek. He calls their universe the cyber.suniverse

## Year 44
Tomasina starts mining cyber.beast to prepare for the draft and meets Kyshumu for the first time in cyberspace
___

Mak learns that Tominia is trying to prevent a war by disguising herself to be a member of renet in order to take the crown.
__

Tomasina is drafted into the Cheif's champion Tournament. Kassiea serves as her coordinator something usally done by retire Xybervators or those that didn't get drafted. She wins her first match which is against Xenos II the the predecessor of the current Cheif Traik.

Her next opponent is against Kyshumu who starts hitting on while she is losing.

    Kassiea: I think he's hitting on you

    Tomasina: I think thats pretty obvious
    : Yes I know that plainlly obvious
    
    Kassiea: no no you misunderstand I mean he is flirting with you
    : No I mean he's hitting ON you

    Tomasina: surely you jest!

    Tomasina: Are you hitting on me

    Tomasina: are you trying to hit on me

    Kyshumu Blushes

It's discovered that Tomasina is from Cytek but thanks to Kyshumu isn't banned by Traik how again wins the cheifs championship after facing his son Kyshumu for the first time in the finals

They soon discover that she is a human. Being an outsider the Cybervators bans her from being allowed to participate

Thanks to the relationship she built with Kyshumu in cyberspace he vouches for her to be allowed participate insisting that his father allows her to compete. He even points out a loop hole in the rules that should allow her to compete

When Kyshumu insists that Tomasina is allowed to compete Traik warns Kyshumu that she is not just here to compete but to send a message. But that he well let her fight so that her people will no that they are no match for them

    She didn't come here just to win the tournement. It's a show of force

Tomasina and Kyshumu meets again in cyberspace. Although she loses the championship she wins the heart of Kyshumu. Kyshumu tells Tomasina that fighting in the real world is nothing like cyberspace that it may feel the same  but it is not that her body is not ready that he has lived his whole life as a cybervator and she has been one for all of one year

## Year 45 cc
ReNet asks to have procedure done on Tomasina to be done on Xenos

Xenos III the grandson of Xenos I is the second-ever Blue.type and the oldest to become one after many failures between him and Tomasina. This was when they discovered a sweet spot age in which a human can be turned into an Xybervator. It was also through Xenos that they learned that blue.types needed satellites in order to safely hyperlink. Even though Xenos's father is a red.type he still became a normal human. This made him a perfect candidate to be turned into a cybervator. The hope was that he would become a red.type but he became a blue.type as he didn't inherit this trait instead.
___

When Makkusu comes to the cyber.suniverse he creates an algorithim that can surpress a cyber.beast even allowing them to be placed in plants rather than in who he calls humans

Makkusu and Kassia made the orginal version but was unable to find a way place and/or control a cyber.beast within it. Max solved the problem Kassia however did not CyTek's impaintence leads them to instead use it to control cybervators someting Kassia had orginal only did to demostrate the potential of the device. In the alternate version CyTek/Kassiea/Makkusu is instead freaked out and hides the technology afraid of potential misuse.

Kasseia demostrates the potential of the device using Xenos as the control
___

Kassiea creates the new CSD that allows her to comptete along xybervators like kyshumu and Xenos. She was the only one that can use though as the controler was to complex although she could see an turn her head with the visor she had to keyboard the commands for everthing else. She was basicly coding the movements of the cyber.beast
___

After Creating a new CSD she teams up with Xenos and then Kyshumu in cyberspace aiding them both in raising in rankings. She does this while still figuring out a way to safely do the procedure on others and figuring out why it worked plants but not others


## Year 46 CC


## Year 47 cc
Tomasina competes in her second Cheifs tournament in hopes of winning allowing cytek to take over ReNet
___


Tomasina confess to joining the Cheifs tournment inorder to take over ReNet

    Tomasina tells Kyshumu I bet you must hate  our world after all us humans have done

    Kyshsumu: Well I... He looks at her

    Well you see I can't really hate it because you're apart of this world too

After losing Tomasina warns the cybervators of a possible war.  They want them to be eventually integrated into society and forced to give up their "barbaric" sport. The winner would eat/suck the tail of the loser--usasly if they have grudge against them--allowing them to take their cyber.beast


    Tomasina: Because they tink you're barbaric. The humans on earth think that you are a threat. Cyber.Beast goining berserk is rare as of late. They are afraid that when you no longer have cyber.beast to fight what will stop humans from being next. 

    Tomasina: They also want control of their satellites back rather than being a the whims of what they consider a barbaric sport

    Kyshumu: what is she talking about father

    Traik: We have been hacking and selling satilites for profits. They are unhackable to everyone accept Xybervators 

    Kyshumu: Why

    Traik:  There is no water on the moon. Once the Cyber.beast are gone there well be no way of sustaining our selves. 

    Kyshumu: So we hack their satellites and they give us water

    Tomasina: And if you're not careful it can turn into a all out war. 

    Traik: how we would never fight each let alone kill each other. And like you said we settle our disputs in the tournament.

    Tomasina: Yes but we would. But thats not what I wanted. I figured that if I could win the championships war wouldn't be necessary. Which is why I am asking we need some sort of partnership. We need to be more than just trade partners we need to be allies. But you have to give up your tournament

    Traik: I would prefer to be allies as but my people would never accept such such despicable/ridiculous terms. Give up a sport that has be apart of our culture for decades. Because they consider it barbaric.

    Kyshumu: You're the Chief Can't you just make them

    Kyshumu/Tomasina: Why not you're the cheif arent you

    Traik: it's not that simple. You think being a cheif means I can do what ever I want. As a chief it is my duty to serve the will of the people. They didn't choose me because they wanted to unite our people with earth.

    Kyshumu: What do you mean. They didn't choose you. You became the because of your own will a determination. They didn't win the championships you did.

    Traik explains how the tournameent works through the collective counciousnes will of the people and that cyber.beast are only a small part of the equation. He tells Tomasina/Kyshumu if they want to go through with this then it is up to them that they must win over the heart and will of the people

___

Kyshumu Wins after getting to face his father Traik in the finals for the second time

After winning the tournament Kyshumu surprise even Tomasina and exclaims that he will marry her that it will be the start relationship of not us just but her entire world. I will bring them our sport and all of its glories This sets up an arranged marriage which would allow the merger of the ReNet tribe and the CyTek company. This would allow Tomasina to accomplish her goals. 

    Kyshumu walks from the podium
    Tomasina(wispers):  Did you forget my people think you sport is barbaric. 

    Kyshumu: I'm sure we will come up with something
___

Kyshumu and Tomasina are arranged to be married so that Cytek and ReNet can merge creating the CNS with ReNet and Cytek which is renamed to BluNet serving as subnets.

Cytek also had seen the merger as an opportunity to clean up their image which is why they renamed the subnet version of their company to BluNet to better align their self with xybervators

With the formation of the CNS league they begin promoting their self telling people that turining thei children into xybrids is grat way to generationally elevate themselves out of poverty

Xybervators are seperated from their non Xybervator parent, children, and spouses to prevent fron forming emtional attachments as the cyberbeast will use these strong emothions to take full possession of the cybervators
___

With the merger/partnership between ReNet and CyTek they promoted waggering the bitgems of a satellite to be more excepted by the masses. This is opposed to waggering the whole satellite as it is more profitable.
___

Both ReNet and BluNet begins put black.type cyber.beast in CSD's simlar to white.type cyber.beast in satellite. This prevents xybervators from going berserk as it is no longer placed directly in the xybervator. extra cyber.beast are stored in satellites and contain by the white.type cyber.beast inside of it.

## Year 48 CC
CyTek continue genticly modifying Cybervator of their own they also hire out cybervators as cyber.beast hunters but the don't hack other satellites with them in order to avoid conflict. They do however employ them as police
___

Airiona is born
## Year 49
Makkusu serves as Tomasina's Cyber.coordinator

Things move along smoothly until Tomasina tells Makkusu if not for her arranged political marriage that she would go back to his world with him. She puts her hand on his check and press her forehead and nose upon his. He assume that she is inviting a kiss.

Jac Makkusu kisses Tomasina

    The kiss between tomasina and Mak is shown off screen and Krocmer walks in with 

    Mak: it was just a kiss!?

    Krocmer: a kiss you to tell me! You deflowered my daughter inlaw

    I don't know how it works on your world but kissing is how we reproduce
## Year 50 cc
The political marriage between Kyshumu and Tomasina to soften tensions between to Cybervators and humans. this falls through after she has a child with Makkusu. Leaving Kyshumu no choice but to move on as he has his own child with the hope or promise that they will fulfill the contracted merger through thier marriage
___

Max and Jax are born
## Year 51
Leona is born

Minia is born

## Year 54 CC
Spike III is born

## Year 59 CC
Leona is arranged to Marry Jax
___

A competetion is arranged amounst human girls to determine who will get adopted by Kyshumu turned into a xybrid and arranged to marry Max. Providing the winners family with generational wealth
___

Minia along with a bunch of other girls gets an affinty test

Minia watches as they start with taking the blood of the first girl and putting it in the elemender.

Minia runs away thinking that she will be killed Max finds her and calls her My Nia

Tomasina Finds and explains the process is so she doesnt die.
    Tomasina: They take your blood and put in an elemender vibrating it a the frequency of your blood in it's purest form. 
    It then forms an element in the shape of the cyber.beast it resonates with

    They then test to see which satellite housed white.type cyber.beast your blood's vibration resonates with. This way you don't have to do anything so their is no risk to you at all
___

Max is arranged to marry Minia

    a crowd of people parts
    Minia walks out of the crowd hand over hand head down and blushing
    the Max smiles and nods his head to say hello like he allways does
        Max(thinking): oh she's back I guess she not dead after all
    Everyone starts claping and some jumping for joy.

        Makkusu: what... no no no. This is all a big misunderstanding
        : what dont you understand
        Makkusu: no you dont understand he didnt--
        : no time to get cold feet know come we must prepare for the ceromony
        Makkusu: I barely even know you people
___

Minia is turned into a Xybrid

## Year 62 CC


Max and Jax is given their cyberbeast affinity test. Jax and Max are both compatible with the lion cyber.beast
leona gets word that Jax and Max has an affinity for the dragon cyber.beast but Max has an affinity for the pheniox cyber.beast of hope the hardest one to tame They use what was at the time called a elemender created by Mak and/or kassia. it works by moving toward the cybervator that it has an affinity for
___

Leona requests for Max to be her partner

    Leona: I think we'll make a great team

later on Leona sees Max with Minia or Airiona maybe noticing that they are both have maximum compatiblity with the pheniox cyber.beast which means they 

    Leona: I have a partner already! We make a great team!

This prompts her to ask Kyshumu to kill Max
___

Max watches the cyber.fighter.league in person for the first time with his father

They watch as the xybervators are teleported into space when walking towards the projector

    Max(young): i dont understannd that sphere is smaller than any one of them but yet they can all fit

    Mack(rubbing Max's head): Haha. How perceptive of you. In my world, it is what we call a back hole. Within it time and space are irrelevant 
___

Max fuses with a white.type that is not attached to a satellite. It's affinity is hope. Xybervators including Kyshumu go into hyperdrive to stop him but given that he is white.type having other black.type cyber.beast around only incentivise it to attack

    I'm Minia and he's... Come on tell him your name

    Max

    and when we become cybervators you're gonna be the one on the losing end you'll see. We'll be better cybervators than you could ever be

    Ha ha ok I'll be waiting
___

Leona pairs with Jax after Max is "killed"
