# Cyber.Beast(History)

## Year 0 CC

Humans began to explore/colonize the moon. Using resources only found on the
moon CyTek creates a new quantum
computer tech. They are unhackable and
indestructible. They are placed
around the moon or the earth's orbit
___

Xenobots called Xybervators are created to mine the moon to create indestructable satellites which are now created with a laser weapon that can attack any location on earth and sold to 12 major nations
___

Through cloning they are able to mass produce the Xybervators along with cyber crystal that the satellite is made of.

Cytek realizes they no longer need to look for the crystals but can create them by cloning cybervators and turning them into satellites. This process would kill them as they can no longer store energy need to live.

People begin to question the rights of the Xybervators as people begin to believe that they might be sentient. This is especially considered given the fact that can be cloned

## Year 1 CC
A civil war breaks out on the moon as they fight to be a independent nation in order to free the Xybervators from slavery. 
___

It quickly turns into a proxy war as nations fight to take down the Cytek organization who many nations decide is unethical and dangerous.
___

It's discovered that cybervators can hack into satellites by meditating, allowing them to Astro project into cyberspace. They can then go into the satellite and hyperlink with what they called cyber.beast housed within it.

At first, no one believed these people until they started controlling the things that were connected to the satellite
___

The Xybervators then join the war some as slaves and others as freedom fighters. At first they are used to take over satellites by hyperlinking with them. They soon realize they can be used as guards for the satellites. This is because only one person can be go inside a satellite at a time.
___
## Year 2 CC
Militarys begin to target Xybervators with the lasers that are meditating to free up the satellites so their own xybervators can cybersquat in the satellite in their stead. This doesn't work however as the satellite protects them from them laser beam. 
___

 The cyber.beast in satellites which are adapt to finding Xybervators are used for hunting Xybervators before they are hyperlinked targeting them with its lasers.
___

To protect hunted cybervators that aren't hyperlinked underground hubs are created. 

The Xybervators that are hyperlinked are placed in a circle at the top of the hub forming a barrier protecting the humans and xybervators in panoptic rooms underneath

## Year 3 CC

Xybervators begin going berserk as they begin to attract what they call black.type cyber.beast. They get the name because they turn the xybervator into a black cyber.beast after hyperlinking with them. This is opposed to being white like the satellites that already have a cyber.beast inside of it 

They began attacking the hyperlinked xybervators near by. This lead to the discovery that berserk xybervators can defeat hyperlinked xybervators. 
___

The enslaved Xybervators are then intentionally turned berserk and sent to destroy hyperlinked Xybervators. It's a reakless move however as Xybervators would wipe out entrire cities as collaterall damage.

Bursun and Yaharia becomes the first xybervators that learn to tame the cyber.beast they fuse with. They defend the Xybervators against the enslaved berserk xybervators.

Given that through his actions he saves citizens as well people begin to look up to him as a war hero

Yaharia teaches Xenos a human being virtous allows a xybervator to tame cyber.beast. He goes on to train other xybervators to do the same.

## Year 4 CC
Humans on both sides of the war are no longer allowed to fight. Battles are now fought between Xybervator with humans serving as cyber.coordinators

Bursun Becomes Chief of the freedom fighters. All though he does not lead them he serves as inspiration and a figure head to the freedom fighter.
___

Xenos starts teaching Xybervators and humans how to defeat Berserk Xybervators by cuting their tail off. This means the don't have to die and can no longer hyperlink with cyber.beast
___

CyTek creates the first CSD which allows them to control the berserk cyber.beast
___

Xenos becomes Eclipse as he decide he wants to do more than train and coordinate the Xybervators, he wants to join the fight as well. His first mission is during an eclipse which is how he gets his name. He is able to save multiple Xybervators without cut off their tails. 

When they are freed they are not forced to join the war however many do join. Amoung them is a young Xybervator named Traik
___

Traik looking up to Bursun and after being saved Xenos him joins the freedom fighters and is trained be Xenos.

Xenos continues train Xebervators and serve as a cyber.coordinator but also goes on missions with Yaharia and Traik as Eclipse. This adds a new Dimension to the war

## Year 5
The tides of the war change as it is discovered and revealed by spike that Yaharia is pregnant this means Xybervators can have children.
___

The war is coming to a close with the freedom fighters looking to be the victors. After capturing one of the Cytek satellites a plan is discovered to kill Xybervators as last ditch effort. They plan do it prefectly timing laser blast targeted at Xybervators during the next lunar eclipse.

Bursun decides he wants to kill all Xybervators as a way to free them. He plans to do this by using the freedom fighter satellites to blow up the moon during the next eclipse
___

Yaharia tries to convince Bursun to not kiil the Xybervators by telling him that she is the Xybervator that is pregnant.

    Did you forget your a Xybervator too do you plan on killing yourself.

    Is this your way for trying to make up for your past

    Bursun: I'm doing this for the next generation. A generation that will be better off without people like me

    Is that what this is about!

    :As soon as you have children you no longer have the right to your own life

    Bursun raise his eye brow

    :it belongs to your children.

    Spike: What are you talking about, you're not making any since

    Yahaira: I'm pregnant

    Spike: Impossible

    Xenos: No it's true I found out during her last systems check Which makes Bursun a uncle

    Bursun: Isn't this what you wanted Yaharia a future your child can live in

    : And you is to say that our child won't be a Xybervator too

    Bursun: You dont have to worry about that but this this right here. If you saw what I have seen you would understand I have no choice
    --or--
    Bursun: You don't understand I have no other choice do you really want your... no our child to live in a world like this a world in which they no free limited to be nothing but a slave. You said it your self you wanted to make the world better for future generations.

Xenos tells Spike if I don't make it just make sure the world knows that Bursun was the hero even if it means I have to be the villain. The world would never accept Cybervators otherwise. Spike asks him but what transparency? Xenos replies I've learned that you can't have everything and that there is a balance and a time and place for everything.

Bursun is defeated during an eclipse by his sister Yaharia, Xenos, and Spike

Before Bursun dies he warns the other Xybervators not to oppress humans, not for the sake of altruism but for the sake of there children's children as they never know when a grandchild may become a part of the humans you hate so much. And if people in power create a world that hates citizens, then your future grandchild may be the one that is hated.

Xenos becomes known as eclipse because he defeated Bursun during an eclipse and the world hates him for killing the hero of the war
